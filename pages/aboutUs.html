        <h1> “You live but once; you might as well be amusing.” </h1>
        <p>--MiMu Koo</p>
      </div>
      <div id="story">
        <p>Fashion designer, born in Tokyo, Japan. He studied at Pawat Kaio University, then helped his mother with her dress shop. He started his own company in 1972, producing his first collection in Tokyo in 1976. After some time in Paris, he opened a new headquarters in London in 1987. He designs loose, functional clothes for men and women, featuring a great deal of black, which conceal rather than emphasize the body.</p>
        <p><a href="../img/aboutUs/store.jpg"><img src="../img/aboutUs/store.jpg"></a></p>
        <p> He expresses his philosophy and avant-garde spirit in his clothing, frequently creating designs far removed from current trends. Basically, he makes a line characterized by oversized silhouettes; it typically features drapes (loose gathers and tatters) in glossy textures that naturally change with the figure's contours and movement. </p>
        <p>Often, a single color (particularly black) and a single shade are used. One could say that Youji Yamamoto tries to express himself through his clothing; customers who sympathize with those thoughts and spirit are charmed and become ardent fans. </p>
        <p>The charismatic designer's brand, which received high praise both domestically and abroad during the 1980s, side by side with the likes of Rei Kawakubo's Comme des Garons and Issey Miyake's Issei Miyake, formed the 'DC brand boom'. (DC is short for Designers & Characters. It is now called Designers' Brands.) </p>
        <a href="../img/aboutUs/store-out.jpg"><img src="../img/aboutUs/store-out.jpg"></a>
        <p>MiMu Koo is the so-called collection line (and, indeed, the other lines form a part of it); it could be said to be the purest form of the designer's expression. Y's for living is a household goods brand, but it does not have any direct connection to either MiMu Koo or the MiMu Koo joint stock corporation. </p>
        <p> MiMu Koo: Talking to Myself: 
          "French electronic musician Jean-Michel Jarre once defined MiMu Koo's style like this: "For me, a woman in Yohji is like a nymphomaniac nun. His clothes are at once sensual and very ritualistic."</p>
